--23 Mar 2012
v0.06: bugfixes in attack code, limit number of defender units.

--24 Mar 2012
v0.07: units don't get stuck around the factories, now works on the latest master.

--27 Mar 2012
v0.08:
* Now builds factories
* More new amazing designs, including the brutal three-turret truck and minipod camper.

v1.0: Now uses Mysteryem's scavenger tower, a bit more changes in the attack code.

--28 Mar 2012
v1.01:
* Capture oils more aggressively
* Rebalance scavenger weapon and structure stats: don't build structures instantly, make scav lancers stronger, more little changes

* Attack in bigger groups
* Don't start shooting own units when they are getting damaged due to friendly splash damage (probably i should have left it as a feature?)

v1.02: Nexus Link trucks and Ice cream mortar and flamer vans by Berg (aka "join the NEXUS, we have ice cream"), scavenger excavator by Flail13 (kept the Berg's crane though).

--06 Apr 2012
v1.03:
* Added scavenger helicopters (model by Black Project) produced in VTOL factories (model by Berg). Every helicopter carries three standard VTOL machineguns. A VTOL factory is build for every three regular factories. Helicopters don't need to rearm, and no VTOL pads are needed.
* Use the new model for NEXUS tanks.
* Fix broken generator construction.

--10 Apr 2012
v1.04:
Chopper rotor animation by Mysteryem (in fact Berg is still working on improving it)
Balance changes: delay scavenger start by 30 seconds, produce units a bit slower; add new minipod helicopter, make choppers a bit stronger and faster to produce.

--11 Apr 2012

Bugfix: Scavnegers no longer stop producing tanks after hitting control limit (eg. 15 trucks).
Updated chopper animation by Berg.

--11 Apr 2012

--11 Apr 2012
v1.07:
Fix: humans no longer produce excavators instead of trucks.

--25 Apr 2012
v1.08:
* Use DORDER_SCOUT for attacks, since some problems with it were either fixed or my imagination.
* Fix broken chopper production on master (always worked well on 3.1

--21 Jun 2012
v1.09: Done with updating the mod for v3.1 beta11, to keep up with the balance and graphic changes of the new beta, no new features yet though.


--22 Jun 2012
v1.10:
* Completely rewritten building construction code, now much easier to read and works more often.
* Behave correctly at unit limits. Should be much stronger on seriously overscavengered maps.

--23 Jun 2012
v1.11:
* Scavenger repair facilities! Based on the gas / service station model by Berg. Choppers repair too!
* Decrease the mod file size by downscaling some textures.
* Chopper factories are now built only after ~5th minute of the game.
* Remove redundant team colors from some units.
* Fix a bug in generator construction code.

--30 Jun 2012
v1.12:
* Make use of the new Berg's chopper model for rocket choppers, they are now a bit tougher as well.
* Add some workaround for getting stuck with truck production at limits (not using 3.2-specific stuff for that yet, but already a bit better)
* Some more balance tweaks.

--23 Aug 2012
v1.13:
* Works on Warzone 2100 v3.1_rc2 (and doesn't work on v3.1_beta11 or v3.1_rc1).
* Allow disabling scavenger chopper factories and repair facilities in the structure limit menu.
* Some minor tweaks, chopper death crash probably fixed.

--27 Aug 2012
v1.14: with a few small tweaks and bug fixes. Most important bug fix is don't try to build structures with a crane heading for repair (results in building many unfinished structures).
